Query methods
=============

.. py:currentmodule:: pg

.. class:: Query

The :class:`Query` object returned by :meth:`Connection.query` and
:meth:`DB.query` can be used as an iterable returning rows as tuples.
You can also directly access row tuples using their index, and get
the number of rows with the :func:`len` function.
The :class:`Query` class also provides the following methods for accessing
the results of the query:

getresult -- get query values as list of tuples
-----------------------------------------------

.. method:: Query.getresult()

    Get query values as list of tuples

    :returns: result values as a list of tuples
    :rtype: list
    :raises TypeError: too many (any) parameters
    :raises MemoryError: internal memory error

This method returns query results as a list of tuples.
More information about this result may be accessed using
:meth:`Query.listfields`, :meth:`Query.fieldname`
and :meth:`Query.fieldnum` methods.

Note that since PyGreSQL 5.0 this method will return the values of array
type columns as Python lists.

Since PyGreSQL 5.1 the :class:`Query` can be also used directly as
an iterable sequence, i.e. you can iterate over the :class:`Query`
object to get the same tuples as returned by :meth:`Query.getresult`.
This is slightly more efficient than getting the full list of results,
but note that the full result is always fetched from the server anyway
when the query is executed.

You can also call :func:`len` on a query to find the number of rows
in the result, and access row tuples using their index directly on
the :class:`Query` object.

dictresult/dictiter -- get query values as dictionaries
-------------------------------------------------------

.. method:: Query.dictresult()

    Get query values as list of dictionaries

    :returns: result values as a list of dictionaries
    :rtype: list
    :raises TypeError: too many (any) parameters
    :raises MemoryError: internal memory error

This method returns query results as a list of dictionaries which have
the field names as keys.

If the query has duplicate field names, you will get the value for the
field with the highest index in the query.

Note that since PyGreSQL 5.0 this method will return the values of array
type columns as Python lists.

.. method:: Query.dictiter()

    Get query values as iterable of dictionaries

    :returns: result values as an iterable of dictionaries
    :rtype: iterable
    :raises TypeError: too many (any) parameters
    :raises MemoryError: internal memory error

This method returns query results as an iterable of dictionaries which have
the field names as keys. This is slightly more efficient than getting the full
list of results as dictionaries, but note that the full result is always
fetched from the server anyway when the query is executed.

If the query has duplicate field names, you will get the value for the
field with the highest index in the query.

.. versionadded:: 5.1

namedresult/namediter -- get query values as named tuples
---------------------------------------------------------

.. method:: Query.namedresult()

    Get query values as list of named tuples

    :returns: result values as a list of named tuples
    :rtype: list
    :raises TypeError: too many (any) parameters
    :raises TypeError: named tuples not supported
    :raises MemoryError: internal memory error

This method returns query results as a list of named tuples with
proper field names.

Column names in the database that are not valid as field names for
named tuples (particularly, names starting with an underscore) are
automatically renamed to valid positional names.

Note that since PyGreSQL 5.0 this method will return the values of array
type columns as Python lists.

.. versionadded:: 4.1

.. method:: Query.namediter()

    Get query values as iterable of named tuples

    :returns: result values as an iterable of named tuples
    :rtype: iterable
    :raises TypeError: too many (any) parameters
    :raises TypeError: named tuples not supported
    :raises MemoryError: internal memory error

This method returns query results as an iterable of named tuples with
proper field names. This is slightly more efficient than getting the full
list of results as named tuples, but note that the full result is always
fetched from the server anyway when the query is executed.

Column names in the database that are not valid as field names for
named tuples (particularly, names starting with an underscore) are
automatically renamed to valid positional names.

.. versionadded:: 5.1

scalarresult/scalariter -- get query values as scalars
------------------------------------------------------

.. method:: Query.scalarresult()

    Get first fields from query result as list of scalar values

    :returns: first fields from result as a list of scalar values
    :rtype: list
    :raises TypeError: too many (any) parameters
    :raises MemoryError: internal memory error

This method returns the first fields from the query results as a list of
scalar values in the order returned by the server.

.. versionadded:: 5.1

.. method:: Query.scalariter()

    Get first fields from query result as iterable of scalar values

    :rtype: list
    :raises TypeError: too many (any) parameters
    :raises MemoryError: internal memory error

This method returns the first fields from the query results as an iterable
of scalar values in the order returned by the server. This is slightly more
efficient than getting the full list of results as rows or scalar values,
but note that the full result is always fetched from the server anyway when
the query is executed.
