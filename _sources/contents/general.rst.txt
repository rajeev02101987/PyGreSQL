General PyGreSQL programming information
----------------------------------------

PyGreSQL consists of two parts: the "classic" PyGreSQL interface
provided by the :mod:`pg` module and the newer
DB-API 2.0 compliant interface provided by the :mod:`pgdb` module.

If you use only the standard features of the DB-API 2.0 interface,
it will be easier to switch from PostgreSQL to another database
for which a DB-API 2.0 compliant interface exists.

The "classic" interface may be easier to use for beginners, and it
provides some higher-level and PostgreSQL specific convenience methods.

.. seealso::

    **DB-API 2.0** (Python Database API Specification v2.0)
    is a specification for connecting to databases (not only PostgreSQL)
    from Python that has been developed by the Python DB-SIG in 1999.
    The authoritative programming information for the DB-API is :pep:`0249`.

Both Python modules utilize the same low-level C extension, which
serves as a wrapper for the "libpq" library, the C API to PostgreSQL.

This means you must have the libpq library installed as a shared library
on your client computer, in a version that is supported by PyGreSQL.
Depending on the client platform, you may have to set environment variables
like `PATH` or `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` so that PyGreSQL can find the library.

.. warning::

    Note that PyGreSQL is not thread-safe on the connection level. Therefore
    we recommend using `DBUtils <http://www.webwareforpython.org/DBUtils>`_
    for multi-threaded environments, which supports both PyGreSQL interfaces.

Another option is using PyGreSQL indirectly as a database driver for the
high-level `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_ SQL toolkit and ORM,
which supports PyGreSQL starting with SQLAlchemy 1.1 and which provides a
way to use PyGreSQL in a multi-threaded environment using the concept of
"thread local storage".  Database URLs for PyGreSQL take this form::

    postgresql+pygresql://username:password@host:port/database
