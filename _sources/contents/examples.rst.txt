Examples
========

I am starting to collect examples of applications that use PyGreSQL.
So far I only have a few but if you have an example for me, you can
either send me the files or the URL for me to point to.

The :doc:`postgres/index` that is part of the PyGreSQL distribution
shows some examples of using PostgreSQL with PyGreSQL.

Here is a
`list of motorcycle rides in Ontario <http://ontario.bikerides.ca>`_
that uses a PostgreSQL database to store the rides.
There is a link at the bottom of the page to view the source code.

Oleg Broytmann has written a simple example
`RGB database demo <http://phdru.name/Software/Python/#rgb_example>`_
